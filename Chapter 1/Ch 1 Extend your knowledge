    <p>If you include a piece of non-text on your website, such as an image, one should also attempt to include a
        text description of said element if possible. This can be done through methods such as using alt attributes
        on image elements for longer descriptions, as well as including a supplimentary text version of the info being described in the element.
    </p>

    <p>For prerecorded audio and video, you can include captions to transcribe when someone is speaking in the audio or video.
        With a higher budget, one can even set up live captioning for a livestream. When captions are not enough to deliver all
        the info of audio or video, you can implement a second optional audio track which provides an audio description of what is
        happening in the video.
    </p>

    <p>The content of your website should be displayed in a clear, malleable format. Information should be sequenced in an
        order that makes sense, as well as making it malleable to different image sizes, orientations, and readers.
    </p>

    <p>Making your important information, such as your text and images, contrast well with your background elements will aid 
        practically almost everyone who is either colourblind or has weak sight. Responsible use of colour can also produce
        this effect. You should also not include any autoplaying audio or video without a way to pause or stop it. You should also
        make it easy for others to resize the text on a webpage without its elements breaking, clashing into each other, or being hidden
        behind each other. Content that is made to appear when you hover over a certain element should be made to persist after the
        cursor is removed as well as dismissable.
