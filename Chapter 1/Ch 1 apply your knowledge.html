    <p>Chapter 1, Apply Your Knowledge</p>

    <p>I've been using Visual Studio Code as my text editor for this assignment and all previous ones, as
        the computer won't allow me to download and install Notepad++ without admin privilages.</p>

    <p>The basic layouts of webpages on a website can be sketched out using a wireframe, where various sized rectangles
        with black outlines are placed on a hypothetical space and labelled with their funtions, like image, text, logo, navigation, etc.
        To figure out how the various webpages of your website will interconnect, one can use a site map. A site map is when one places representations of 
        each web page together, and draws lines based on how they interconect, as well as if a webpage is accessible from others and vice versa.</p>

    <p>Sp far, I've learned the very basics of using HTML5 to create a webpage and open it in my web browser. I've also 
        learned how to organize the various webpages on a website using methods such as a webbed site structure and a
        hiearchical site structure.</p>
